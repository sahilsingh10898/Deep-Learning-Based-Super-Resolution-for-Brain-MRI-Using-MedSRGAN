# Deep Learning-Based Super-Resolution for Brain MRI Using MedSRGAN

This repository contains the implementation of **MedSRGAN**, a deep learning-based **super-resolution model** for enhancing **Brain MRI images**. The model is based on the **Residual Whole Map Attention Network (RWMAN)** and a **discriminator network**, trained in an adversarial manner to generate high-resolution MRI scans.

## 📌 Project Overview

The **MedSRGAN** framework consists of:
- **Generator (RWMAN)**: A deep convolutional neural network with residual attention blocks to generate high-resolution MRI scans from low-resolution images.
- **Discriminator**: A convolutional network that distinguishes real high-resolution images from generated ones.
- **Loss Functions**: A combination of adversarial loss, perceptual loss, and SSIM-based structural loss.
